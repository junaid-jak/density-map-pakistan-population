A README file contains information about the other files
 in a directory or archive of computer software. A form 
of documentation, it is usually a simple plain text file
 called README, Read Me, READ.ME, README.TXT,[1] README.md 
(to indicate the use of Markdown), or README.1ST.[2]

The file's name is generally written in uppercase. 
On Unix-like systems in particular, this causes it
 to stand out â€“ both because lowercase filenames
 are more common, and because the ls command commonly 
sorts and displays files in ASCII-code order, in which 
uppercase filenames will appear first.[nb 1]
